# Getting Started

Lets get you started on integrating SBX into your base theme. The first place you should go is the first link below, "Adding SBX To You Theme". That will help you get the framework properly added and the API available for you to use. After that, follow through to "Enabling SBX Features" which will help you integrate and understand the available components to make your theme awesome. Browse the rest of the links as you find need, and if you ever get stuck, hop over to the [Support Forum](http://wpstartbox.com/support/) and ask your questions there.
