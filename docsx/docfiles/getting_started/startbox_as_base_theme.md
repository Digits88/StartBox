# Using StartBox as a parent theme.

Whenever you start a website, and you decide on a theme, it is good to keep in mind whether you should modify the selected theme directly, or if you should create a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) out of it. If it is a premium theme, you will definitely want to give this a hard consideration. The best rule of thumb we suggest is that if the theme is ever likely to receive updates from the original theme author, you definitely should create a child theme.

With SBX already available and enabled in StartBox, it is not difficult at all to get going on your child theme and begin safely making edits to the site, that will not be overwritten by future updates. This gives you all the flexibility you are already expecting, and worry free hassle.
