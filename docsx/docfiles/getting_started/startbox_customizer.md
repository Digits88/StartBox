# StartBox Customizer

Since the release of WordPress 3.4, theme developers have had the "Theme Customizer" available to give users, of their theme, the ability to easily set specified theme settings. This customizer is accessed through the Themes submenu, located under Appearance menu. You can access the customizer with the "Customize" link for your active theme, and the "Live Preview" link for inactive themes.

StartBox utilizes the customizer to help you set up your StartBox theme or child theme. In the rest of this tutorial, we will go through each customizer setting that StartBox provides, and discuss what each does and can be used for.

## Branding Settings

The first customizer section that StartBox uses is the Branding Settings. Here you will see 4 different options to set related to your branding and representation by way of your website graphics and icons on smartphone devices or tablets.

### Favicon

The favicon is a long standing graphic that users see next to their url address bar in their browsers, as well as with bookmarks. Traditionally it has been a 16px x 16px ico file, but with the growing popularity of "retina" or high-definition displays, it is a good idea to move that up 2x to 32px x 32px.

### Touch Icon

Touch Icons are png graphics that Apple uses with their iOS devices, when a person adds a bookmark to their home screen. The 152px x 152px icon displays similar to an iOS app that they have installed, and allows for quick access to your site at the touch of the finger.

### Tile Icon

#### Icon uploading

Similar to the iOS Touch Icon, is the Tile Icon for Windows 8 devices. This graphic is going to be a 144px x 144px png file that gets added to their phone for quick access.

With all three icon selectors, you have the ability to upload a new image and it will be saved for you. You can either drag-n-drop an image onto the dashed border area, or use the "select a file" link to display an upload file dialog box that you can use to select an image. Once an image has been set to use, you can also remove it with the "Remove image" link that appears after you set the image. If you remove the selected image but decide you want to re-set it again, you do not need to re-upload the graphic. An "Uploaded" tab will appear after you've uploaded a graphic and you can re-select it there.

If you close the Customizer and then return later. You will not have the "Uploaded" tab available still and you'll need to re-upload. See note below regarding a caveat of this need.

* Note. When you upload a graphic via these uploaders, a copy of the file is also set in your media library. If you have tried out many and finally set on one, you can decide if you want to keep the other graphics in the media library or remove them with the Media Library manager.

### Tile Icon background

Unlike the Touch Icon, you get to also choose the background color that will be used with your tile icon. Use this color picker to select the color you want. To use, just click the "select color" button, and a color picker will pop up for you. Here you'll be able to select the desired color in a few different ways.

First is the hex color input where, if you know the hex color code you want, you can type it in directly and move to the next step. However, if you are not sure what that value is, you can instead use the color spectrum and slider to make a color choice. Lastly there is the pre-selected color spots below the spectrum selector with some familiar colors already chosen.

If you wish to go back to the original default color, just click the "Default" button in the upper right section and the color selector will reset. To hide the color picker after you are done, click the "Current Color" button and it will toggle itself closed.

## Post Content Settings

The second customizer section that StartBox offers is for Post Content Settings. Here you can set three different settings relate to your posts display.

### Post Header Meta

This textarea allows you to set whats called the Byline of your post. By default it displays that the post was published by which author, at what date and time, and in what category/categories. It makes use of four different WordPress shortcodes that dynamically display the appropriate content for the specific post. This way you do not have to worry about hardcoding anything. All available shortcodes will be discussed in a separate tutorial and are available to be seen in the StartBox documentation.

### Post Footer Meta

Similar to the the Post Header Meta, this textarea allows you to set what appears at the end of your posts. By default it displays a list of categories, followed by a list of tags, and then an edit link only for users who have edit capabilities for the current post.

### Display Author Box

This checkbox toggles if you want to display the post author's information and biography from their user profile. It will display below the post, but above the comments section, when viewing the individual post. It will not display on the front page or archives.

## Footer settings

In this section you have two different settings available to change in the footer area of your website.

### Return to Top Link

This checkbox is used to determine if you want to offer a "return to top" link for your users to quickly and easily return to the top of a long page. This will help prevent them from having to manually scroll with their trackpad or mouse.

### Site Credits

With this textarea, you can set the credits that appear at the bottom of the page. By default it shows the copyright year(s) next to your site link, followed by what your site is proudly powered by. See the appropriate documentation on all of the available shortcodes available.

## Conclusion

That covers all of the sections and settings that StartBox offers you and your users. With these, you can easily set many various parts of your website with ease and get you started on your path to a popular website.
