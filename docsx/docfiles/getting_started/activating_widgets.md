# Activating Widgets

To make use of Startbox's pre-defined widget areas, go to Appearance > Widgets. To activate a widget, just drag it into whichever area you would like it to appear.

**A special note about the Footer Columns**: Startbox will automatically set the column widths based on how many columns you have activated. You should always start with column one and fill in the rest as necessary.
