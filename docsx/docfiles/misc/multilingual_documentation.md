# Multilingual Documentation

To help translate the StartBox Docs, just get started! The guidelines for translating the StartBox Documentation is no different from the ones for documenting it in English. Please be sure to place a link on the original document linking to the translated document, and vice versa.

For those who are multilingual, if you find an article in, say, Japanese that matches one in Russian, please add those links as well. By adding the link to the original English article, we can also cross reference all the various language versions without knowing the language of the article. The more we can cross link between languages, the more the StartBox Docs can serve everyone.
