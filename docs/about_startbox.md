# About StartBox

>Startbox is a dynamic, feature-rich WordPress theme framework that helps developers and designers build better themes more quickly and easily. Startbox is perfect for personal or professional WP theme design and has been thoroughly tested and approved by well know developers. You can use Startbox to create themes for client projects or to create and sell your own Child Themes on popular marketplaces like ThemeGarden or your own site!

## Features

StartBox is a theme framework that makes rapid web development and WP theme creation simple for designers and developers alike. StartBox comes pre-loaded with customizable theme options, several widget-ready areas and comprehensive documentation.

## License and Platform

* License : StartBox is licensed under the [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
* Platform : [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (3.0 or newer), [PHP](http://php.net/) (5.0 or newer) and [MySQL](http://mysql.com/) (4.1.2 or newer) are required.

## Better Theme Options

StartBox comes with an incredibly easy-to-use, modular settings page. For users, this means a quick and painless setup for your website, for theme authors this means an incredible new level of control for your themes.

StartBox follows convention over configuration to trim the fat and give you exactly the options you need. Check them out below!

### Easy-to-Use Options API

Theme Authors can add and remove options at will with our easy-to-use [Options API](options-api/). No complex programming required.

### Header and Navigation Settings

Customize your site by uploading your own logo and favicon. You can also select your navigation menus here. StartBox fully supports the custom menus introduced in WordPress 3.0.

### Content and Layout Settings

StartBox gives you several controls for how content should appear on your homepage and interior pages. Specify where to display post navigation, what meta information to include and more.

### Footer Settings

It’s your site, so you should be allowed to choose what the footer says. Toggle on/off copyright information, design credits, and even include custom text.

### Help is One Click Away

We know how frightening an unfamiliar options page can be, that’s why we’ve built in a link to take you straight to the StartBox documentation. For theme authors, we’ve added a filter so you can specify your own URL here.

### Analytics and Feedburner Settings

Quickly and easily insert analytics (stat tracking) code into every page on your site and redirect your feed URLs to feedburner (or another service).

### SEO Settings

Rather than build our own robust SEO configurations we thought it would be best to leave that to the experts. StartBox has been optimized throughout to integrate well with popular SEO plugins like [WordPress SEO](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

## Custom Sidebars

In version 2.5, StartBox introduced the ability to register custom sidebars from within the WordPress dashboard. This makes it possible for users to create as many unique sidebars as they might need and provides the opportunity to replace particular sidebars on any given page, post type, tag, category or other custom taxonomy. Sidebars can also be called into any content now via a custom shortcode.

## Easy to Customize

StartBox is extremely easy to customize via Child Themes. In fact, StartBox comes with a blank child theme, dummy content and an Out-of-the-Box guide to make rapid development even faster.

StartBox uses modular scripts and stylesheets (so you only include the ones you need) and a dynamic CSS class structure (so you transform the look without changing the markup) and has over 50 hooks and filters (so you can inject any kind of code wherever you need it). Combine that with the easy-to-use Options API and you’re golden!

### StartBox Easy Hooks

To make the hooks even more accessible to end-users we also have our very own [StartBox Easy Hooks](http://wordpress.org/plugins/startbox-easy-hooks/) plugin so that you can drop content into any of the available hooks.

## Support & Upgrades

### Getting Started

We know how frustrating or frightening it can be getting started with a new system. To help offset that we’ve produced a helpful Out-of-the-Box manual that will help you with installation and setup as well as get you started with the basics of child theme development.

### Always Up-to-Date

We take care of compatibility so you don’t have to worry. StartBox is guaranteed to always be compatible with the latest version of WordPress and all the current, popular browsers. Our built-in automatic upgrade feature ensures that you're always running the latest version of StartBox.

### Friendly Support

Never feel stupid or ignored. Everyone runs into problems at some point and we’re here to help. Whatever your question is we’ll do our best to answer it as quickly and completely as possible.

### Comprehensive Documentation

As you can see, there are a lot of features packed into StartBox, and all of them are documented for your ease of use. For developers, we’ve also included in-line documentation so that you can better understand what a function is doing and how/why it’s doing it. Of course, if you ever get stuck, we have the friendly support forums to get you headin’ in the right direction.

### Money-Back Guarantee

We’re proud of our product and certain that it will help you build and launch websites faster. But, if you’re not completely satisfied in the first 30 days, we want to make sure you get your money back. In fact, if you ask us, we’ll even refer you to other theme developers who might better meet your needs!
